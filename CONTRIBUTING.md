# Contributing to vCloud Walker

We now consider vCloud Tools feature complete for our purposes. We'd be happy to consider pull requests for new features but please discuss them with us in the issues first so we can let you know if it's something we'd be likely to merge. We will continue to make maintenance and bug fixes.

## A quick guide on how to contribute

1. Clone the repo:

        git clone git@github.com:gds-operations/vcloud-walker.git

2. Run `bundle` to get the required dependecies

3. Run the tests. Pull requests that add features must include unit tests,
   so it is good to ensure you've got them passing to begin with.

        bundle exec rake

   If you have access to a live environment for testing, it would be great
   if you could run the integration tests too - for more details on the
   set-up for that, please see the [integration tests README]
   (https://github.com/gds-operations/vcloud-walker/blob/master/spec/integration/README.md)

4. Add your functionality or bug fix and a test for your change. Only refactoring and
   documentation changes do not require tests. If the functionality is at all complicated
   then it is likely that more than one test will be required. If you would like help
   with writing tests please do ask us.

5. Make sure all the tests pass, including the integration tests if possible.

6. Update the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/gds-operations/vcloud-walker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
   with a short description of what the change is. This may be a feature, a bugfix, or an
   API change. If your change is documenation or refactoring, you do not need to add a line
   to the CHANGELOG.

7. Fork the repo, push to your fork, and submit a pull request.

## How soon will we respond?

We will comment on your issue as soon as we can. If you feel your issue is important, please feel free to bump it by making a comment on it or raise your issue on the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/forum/#!forum/vcloud-tools).
