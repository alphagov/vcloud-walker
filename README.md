# VCloud Walker

Vcloud-walker is a command line tool, to describe different VMware vCloud
Director 5.1 entities. It uses Fog under the hood.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'vcloud-walker'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vcloud-walker

## Usage
To find usage, run `vcloud-walk`.

You can perform following operations with walker.

#### Walk vdcs:
   vcloud-walk vdcs

describes all vdcs within given organization. This includes vapp, vm and network
information.

#### Walk catalogs:
    vcloud-walk catalogs

describes all catalogs and catalog items within given organization.

#### Walk organization networks:
     vcloud-walk networks

describes all organization networks.

#### Walk edgegateways:
    vcloud-walk edgegateways

describes all edgegateway for given organization. Each edgegateway includes
configuration for firewall, load balancer and nat services.

#### Walk entire organization:
     vcloud-walk organization

describes the entire organization, which includes edgegateway, catalogs,
networks and vdcs within an organization.

### Credentials

You will need to specify the credentials for your VMware environment.
Vcloud-walker uses fog to query the VMware api,
which offers two ways to do this.

#### 1. Create a `.fog` file containing your credentials

An example of .fog file is:

````
default:
  vcloud_director_username: 'user_id@org_id'
  vcloud_director_password: 'password'
  vcloud_director_host: 'api_endpoint'

test2:
  vcloud_director_username: 'user_id@org_id2'
  vcloud_director_password: ''
  vcloud_director_host: 'api_endpoint2'
````

To understand more about `.fog` files, visit the 'Credentials' section on
[fog's 'getting started' page] (http://fog.io/about/getting_started.html).

To use this you can either use a `default` credential set as above, or set the
`FOG_CREDENTIAL` environmental variable to the credential set in the `.fog` file
that you wish to use.

#### 2. Log on externally and supply your session token

Rather than specifying your password in your `.fog` file, you can
instead log on externally with the API and supply your session token
to the tool via the `FOG_VCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable. This
option reduces risk by allowing the user to store their credentials in
safe storage. The default token lifetime is '30 minutes idle' - any
activity extends the life by another 30 mins.

First create a `.fog` file in your home directory as above, but set the password
to a empty string: `''`. The version of fog we currently use requires this key,
but we don't use it.

You then need to log on independently and get a session token. A basic example
of this would be the following:

    curl -D- -d '' \
       -H 'Accept: application/*+xml;version=5.1' -u '<user>@<org>' \
       https://api.vcd.portal.skyscapecloud.com/api/sessions

This will prompt for your password.

From the headers returned, select the header shown below and use it in the
`FOG_VCLOUD_TOKEN` environment variable.

     x-vcloud-authorization: AAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDEEEEEEFFFFF=


You can either export the `FOG_VCLOUD_TOKEN` and `FOG_CREDENTIAL` environment
variables or specify them at the start of your command, (The value of the
`FOG_CREDENTIAL` environment variable is the name of the credential set in your
fog file which you wish to use.)  For instance:

    FOG_CREDENTIAL=test2 FOG_VCLOUD_TOKEN=AAAABBBBBCCCCCCDDDDDDEEEEEEFFFFF= \
       vcloud-launch node.yaml

### Output

Walker can output data in JSON or YAML format. The default output format is JSON.
You can use command line option ```--yaml``` for yaml output.

Find sample json output in docs/examples directory.

## The vCloud API

vCloud Tools currently use version 5.1 of the [vCloud API](http://pubs.vmware.com/vcd-51/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.vcloud.api.doc_51%2FGUID-F4BF9D5D-EF66-4D36-A6EB-2086703F6E37.html). Version 5.5 may work but is not currently supported. You should be able to access the 5.1 API in a 5.5 environment, and this *is* currently supported.

The default version is defined in [Fog](https://github.com/fog/fog/blob/244a049918604eadbcebd3a8eaaf433424fe4617/lib/fog/vcloud_director/compute.rb#L32).

If you want to be sure you are pinning to 5.1, or use 5.5, you can set the API version to use in your fog file, e.g.

`vcloud_director_api_version: 5.1`

## Debugging

`export EXCON_DEBUG=true` - this will print out the API requests and responses.

`export DEBUG=true` - this will show you the stack trace when there is an exception instead of just the message.
